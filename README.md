# Image Slider Sample

## Goal:
- To have a simple way to show a collection of images to slide/rotate through like a banner.

## Application:
- Rotate through a list of images that are retrieved from local file system, or from an API call, or from database (local or online).
- Support for dynamic amounts of images. No hardcoding as we want to be able to add/remove/change the images. The dimensions of the images can be restricted, as it'll probably be weird/ugly to have changing dimensions in a image slider.
